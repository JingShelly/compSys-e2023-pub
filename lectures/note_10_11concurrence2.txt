inter- Thread communication:
channels: you can use socket or use complete different processes 

int pfd
pipe(pfd);
A pipe is unidirectional with a dedicated read and write file descriptions. 

write()
read()

strdup


dev/null: shorthand for ignoring the output

why  the more threads not always faster than one thread

because too many threads will cause too much step in which will add up the time 

thread pool

physical cores and hyper threads/hyper cores:
hyper threads creates an ohter set of registers, it can only do one register physcially but
it will not unload or load a bundle of registers. You donnot need to implemente another CPU, cache and so on
It is kind of a hardware cheat 

more processes will not gurantee speed up, because there will always be some overhead
